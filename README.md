# Life Insurance Cost Prediction

### In this project, we were asked to experiment with a real world dataset, and to explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the output from our data.

### We were expected to gain experience using common machine learning libraries like Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib etc. and were expected to submit a report about the data we collected from actual and predicted values which we used to plot graphs for our four models and the algorithms used.

### After performing the required tasks on a dataset which was given to us, herein lies our final report.

#### Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.compose, sklearn.decomposition, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics, mpl_toolkits

#### Software Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.9

##### Keywords: Machine Learning, Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Supervised learning, Artificial Intelligence.
